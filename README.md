# Code for Functional Normalizing Flows
## Overview
The program relies on FEniCS (Version 2019.1.0) and PyTorch (Version 1.10.0).

1.The whole code is divided into three parts, namely 1D problem, 2D problem and conditional flow, which correspond to the 1D problem, the 2D problem in Section 4,  and the numerical experiment results of conditional functional normalizing flow in Section 5. Some files with identical names appear in multiple folders. While these files share similar functionalities, their specific implementations may vary across different contexts.

1. Directory **core** contains the main functions and classes that are useful for implementing the algorithms. Specifically,
- **probability.py**: This file contains classes of GaussianElliptic2[The Gaussian measure implemented by finite element methods based on solving elliptic differential equations used for generating samples and also contains the functionality of evaluate the gradient and Hessian operators];
- **noise.py**: This file contains the class NoiseGaussianIID.
- **model.py**: This file contains the class Domain and two classes Domain2D and Domain1D inherit from the parent class Domain; contains the parent class ModelBase of the model classes employed in specific examples, the class ModelBase incorporates the components of the domain, prior, equation solver, and noise. 
- **linear_eq_solver.py**: contains the function cg_my which is our implementation of the conjugate gradient algorithm for solving linear equations. 
- **eigensystem.py**: This file contains the function double_pass which is our implementation of an algorithm for calculating eigensystem.

This file also contains the function construct_measurement_matrix, which will be used for generating a sparse matrix S. The matrix S times a function generated by FEniCS to get the values at the measurement points.

Each model accepts an input dimension 'dim', facilitating experiments across various discrete settings. This folder is dedicated to investigating the modelâ€™s discrete invariance property.
